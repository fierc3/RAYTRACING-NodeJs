# RAYTRACING-NodeJs
A Nodejs project setup for the HSLU module RAYTRACING.
This project allows the connection to the canvas server with NodeJs.
NodeJs is a runtime engine based on Chrome v8. 
This makes javascript files executable without a browser and removes a lot of fluff like html / css files.

## Quickstart

      node .\node-example.js
